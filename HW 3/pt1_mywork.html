    <p>This page will consist of all my projects, ranging from app prototypes to physical objects.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 12px;">This picture was taken moments after creation!</p>

    <p>I made this flower for a class called <i>Designing Interactive Experiences</i>. The goal for this project was to visit a landmark that I found interesting, conduct research on it, and interfere with it in some way during the visit.</p>

    <p>Instead of visiting a well-known statue or building, I decided to visit a place that meant a lot to me. The now closed restaurant, Pinoy Kabayan, was the only Filipino restaurant in the Greater Boston area. After hearing about its closure, I decided to visit the place and leave this flower I made to honor its legacy.</p>

    <p>Using printing and magazine paper, I glued together this flower to put on the restaurant's outside ledge. When presenting, I received many compliments from peers on the thoughtfulness that went into creating this artwork. It will remain one of my favorite projects to have worked on.</p>
