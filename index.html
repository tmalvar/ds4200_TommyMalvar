    <h1>Welcome to Tommy Malvar's Digital Portfolio!</h1>

    <p>This website is one of many that I will be making in my near future. My name is Tommy Malvar, I am 21 years old, and hail from New Wilmington, Pennsylvania.</p>

    <p>I major in Data Science and Business Administration, and minor in Interaction Design. Since starting college, I grew an interest in UI / UX Design. I initially started off as purely Business Administration, and had a steady interest in advertising. After meeting more people at university and learning about their backgrounds, I realized that they are either majoring in a complex subject or are heavily involved in different activities. This realization left me feeling inclined to do more. After learning about UI / UX Design, I started a journey that has taken me to my current position.</p>

    <p>I started out with Business and Design. No coding was involved, the only objective was to understand the "why" factor. I learned to investigate deeper, think beyond the barriers of traditional thought. After some time, I felt dissatisfied with what I was doing. The classes were not fulfilling. Assignments were not challenging or applicable enough to my desired career path. Once I looked into the combined program with Data Science and Business Administration, I knew immediately that this learning path would be more valuable. Although I had fearful perceptions of coding, I knew I must break through at some point.</p>

    <p>Two years later, I am halfway through my course path and am truly satisfied with the choices I made. Learning the fundamentals of data analysis and applying programmatic methods to efficiently understand real-world problems brings joy to my heart every day. This new passion will hopefully become my life and lead me to new opportunities to grow — not only as an analyst but as a human being.</p>
